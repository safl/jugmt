Install
-------

Since the tool is implemented in Python, distributed via PyPI and exercised
from the command-line, then ``pipx`` does a great job at creating a
virtual-environment for it and an entry-point to the command-line utility.

Thus, install it by running::

  pipx install jugmt

And ensure that you have the system libraries ``libxml2`` and ``libxslt``
available.
