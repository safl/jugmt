jugmt: JUst Give Me Tables
==========================

**jugmt** is a minimalistic **spex** (SPecification EXtractor)
**implementation** with a codebase less than **200** lines of Python::

  SLOC	Directory	SLOC-by-Language (Sorted)
  146     src             python=146
  47      tests           python=47
  
  Totals grouped by language (dominant language first):
  python:         193 (100.00%)

The tool extracts figure information and tables from ``.docx`` files, generates
**HTML** and **JSON**, and validates the **JSON** using a **JSON** schema.

It does so for various NVMe specification documents, including Base, Boot, MI,
NVM, ZNS, KV, PCI, RDMA, and TCP. It performs these tasks in about **5 seconds**
on an i7-1360P using a single thread and uses approximately **500MB** of memory.

This implementation is designed to be efficient and lightweight. For more
information on the source code, extracted table formats, and validation, please
refer to the `online documentation <https://safl.dk/jugmt>`_
